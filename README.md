# php 8.4.1+ ONLY. No earlier versions of php should be used to run php code. 


I don't f/w php much due to its many vulnerabilities- its an uphill battle. Most new users know of 1 or 2 vulns, there are way more. In fact, at runtime unexpeted behavior happens that ai or pro devs do not predict or find. Php is what it is. So to mitigate some probs, make your codebase small for sure. Complexity = vulns in php and that is a fact. 

This is the only repo i put php in. But the apps will be small, and somewhat secure. The apps will try to be useful. 

# Elite modern apps-


  # Introducing Adelia- made with advanced ai- the 3 file imageboard with the features that vichan has. First versions will be in sqlite3, then postgreSQL db !! 
1) /Adelia quite a remarkable privacy focused imageboard for its super small code base. Upload the 3 tiny files to a server with php 8.4.1 and sqlite3 installed. Supports trip codes, replies, jpg, gif, png, webp and mp4. Its just hard coded to show the very last reply on the main board under the orifinal post, but in reply mode all the replies show up. Css easily changed. logs any errors to error.txt  Security heavily implemented. A must see app. 

2) /Adelia1 Pagination for main board added to /Adelia. This has to be the most features and security fit into a small tiny imageboard app, for real. This board is so nice and full featured that i will make a postgres version too in a while. I will work on the sqlite3 version a bit more and finish it up. The PostgreSQL version will be way better than the sqlite3 version.

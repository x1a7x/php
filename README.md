# php 8.4.1 ONLY. No earlier versions of php should be used to run php. 


I don't f/w php much due to its many vulnerabilities- its an uphill battle. Most new users know of 1 or 2 vulns, there are way more. In fact, at runtime unexpeted behavior happens that ai or pro devs do not predict or find. Php is what it is. So to mitigate some probs, make your codebase small for sure. Complexity = vulns in php and that is a fact. 

This is the only repo i put php in. But the apps will be small, and somewhat secure. The apps will try to be useful.

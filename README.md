# php 8.4.1+ ONLY. No earlier versions of php should be used to run php code. 


I don't f/w php much due to its many vulnerabilities- its an uphill battle. Most new users know of 1 or 2 vulns, there are way more. In fact, at runtime unexpeted behavior happens that ai or pro devs do not predict or find. Php is what it is. So to mitigate some probs, make your codebase small for sure. Complexity = vulns in php and that is a fact. 

This is the only repo i put php in. But the apps will be small, and somewhat secure. The apps will try to be useful. 

# apps

1) Adelia quite a remarkable imageboard for its super small code base. Upload the 3 tiny files to a server with php 8.4.1 and sqlite3 installed. Supports trip codes, replies, jpg, gif, png, webp and mp4. Its just hard coded to show the very last reply on the main board under the orifinal post, but in reply mode all the replies show up. Css easily changed. A must see app.

this is very nice. you can put a either a lightbox or use js so when an image is clicked on, it expands. No mod area made yet because having a seperate php file for that is more secure, to NOT have a front facing admin area is always more secure than having one. ALSO there are sqlite3 editors...which is all the mod functions one needs!  I will keep this dev stage here on purpose, as it is easy to feed this to chatgpt or something and make any changes you want. no mp4 upload enabled yet, that way one can use ffmpeg or not, lots of options depending on how light or heavy you want it to be. THis is VERY flexible and easy to change anything.

# SQLite Message Board with Image Upload

This is a simple PHP-based message board application that allows users to submit posts, including optional images, which are stored in an SQLite database. This project is designed to run on PHP version 8.4.1 and makes use of SQLite3 for data storage and file uploads for image handling.

## Features

- **Post Messages**: Users can post messages with a character limit of 14,000 characters.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF) with their posts, which are displayed alongside the message.
- **Pagination**: Users can select the number of posts to display (5, 15, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500).
- **SQLite Storage**: Uses SQLite3 as the backend database to store post data.
- **Responsive UI**: Simple, clean HTML and CSS for displaying posts.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.4.1 or later.
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) configured to handle PHP.
- Write permissions for the folder containing the script (to create the SQLite database and upload images).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Copy the Files**:
   - Copy all PHP files, the `style.css` stylesheet, and any other resources to your web server's root directory.

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - The SQLite database (`database.db`) will be created automatically when you run the script for the first time.

3. **Uploads Directory**:
   - Ensure the script has permission to create the `uploads/` directory. This is where all uploaded images are stored. The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the location where you have placed the script (e.g., `http://localhost/index.php`).

### Usage

- **Posting a Message**:
  - Fill out the `Name` field (maximum 14 characters).
  - Write a message in the `Post` field (up to 14,000 characters).
  - Optionally, upload an image (JPG, PNG, GIF).
  - Click the `Post` button to submit your message.

- **Viewing Posts**:
  - The posts are displayed with the newest at the top.
  - Images (if included) are displayed at the top-left corner of each post, resized to `200x200` pixels.
  - You can select the number of posts to view by clicking one of the available options (e.g., 5, 15, 25, etc.).

## Code Structure

- **`index.php`**: Main PHP file containing all logic to handle posting, image upload, and displaying posts.
- **`style.css`**: Stylesheet to manage the visual appearance of the board.
- **`uploads/`**: Directory created to store uploaded images.

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: The script uses `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize user inputs, preventing HTML injection.
- **Image Upload Validation**: Only allows image files (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `png`) to be uploaded.
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions are set for `uploads/` and the root directory so unauthorized users cannot access or modify files.

## Compatibility

- **PHP Version**: Tested on PHP 8.4.1. This script makes use of the latest PHP features, so compatibility with earlier versions is not guaranteed.
- **Browser Compatibility**: The HTML and CSS are compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

## Potential Improvements

- **Database Migration**: Consider moving to a more robust database system like MySQL for better scalability if the application grows.
- **CSRF Protection**: Currently, there is no CSRF token validation. This could be added for additional security.
- **Error Handling**: More detailed error messages and logging would help in troubleshooting issues.
- **Pagination**: Add full pagination support for better navigation through posts.
- **File Size Limit**: Add a file size limit for image uploads to prevent excessively large files from being uploaded.

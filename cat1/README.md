#  News- https://github.com/x1a7x/cat4 has a far superior version of this. 

# see my git repo of cat with highest number (for example cat3) for the latest version. Earlier more simple versions are great to veer off in your own direction if you want.

I never liked how vichan has so many files. So i made an ib that looks like vichan but only has 3 php files. Vichan js files (for all sorts of functionality) and vichan css sheets are drop in solutions for this board. This becomes any vichan featured board you want, 99 percent less bloat, way more secure and way more adaptable to future versions of php. Sometimes there is great power in simplicity. Why  have a board that has every feature possible and the codebase of hundreds of files when you can use something like this (using any db) that only has the features you want, no bloat and easy to feed to ai to keep weekly security audits? This was made specifically for php 8.4.1 . Just upload to a  php 8.4.1 (or above) server, run the install.php. Note- if you try to go to index.php before the install script runs you will find an error in your error log. Every system config is different, but keep an eye on error.log. Some entries are normal and expected because of they way your specific system is configured but do not mean anything is wrong. Keep an eye on the error log tho. 

This app is modular and can drop in vichan  css and js. That means with absolute minimal effort, this board can look or have any function that vichan does. Show me a similar versatile app that is 3 php files. Show me an app that is better ready for the next php versions. Show me an app that is easier to feed all the code to ai to audit and add security fixes. Show me an app that does ALL of the above at once like this app does. Yes, this app is simple, it is also elite. There is nothing even close to it. It is incredibly easy to feed this code to ai and make it work with postgre, maria db, firebird db, anything at all.

Literally, there is power in simplicity. This app can do what other apps can not do because of the baked in simplicity.

Vichan maintainers should literally replace all the vichan code with this app- and focus on small modular fixes. In other words take apart vichan functions for modular and small files that can be added or removed from a small app like this.

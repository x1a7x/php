# see my git repo of cat with highest number (for example cat3) for the latest version. Earlier more simple versions are great to veer off in your own direction if you want. 












This is a vast improvment from https://github.com/x1a7x/cat1  see /cat1 for screenshots. 


You see, this makes static files like vichan does so the work load of sqlite3 is greatly reduced- page load time is greatly reduced, server load is greatly reduced and the ability for this to handle more visitors is greatly increased. This is made for php 8.4.1 and any lesser versions of php may not work on it. 

/js and /css go in ur site root dir. board1 and so forth can be named anything. copy board1 into new directories to make more boards. run install.php from each directory where you have a seperate board.

this is tinyib - the only thing i did is remove a bunch of files, made it for sqlite3 only (the code is still there for the other db uses and captcha, all you have to do is restore the directoryies from the latest ver of tinyib on rocket9.

When i wrote this, there are a few deprications like when mp4 uploading- on php 8.4.1 there needed to be some fixes, so i did it. THis code is just whats there out of tinyib after i removed a lot of files and directories entirely, and i had Ai fix a few deprication errors. As such, this code is vey nice- the only changes i did were removal of lots of stuff you do not need, (entire directories and files) and also fixing some deprications.
